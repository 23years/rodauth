= New Features

* A jwt_cors feature has been added, handling Cross-Origin Resource
  Sharing when using the jwt feature, including supporting CORS
  preflight requests.

= Other Improvements

* Mail templates that include links (e.g. for verifying accounts),
  now add a space after the link and before the newline, fixing
  issues with some web mail providers that have broken auto-linkers.
