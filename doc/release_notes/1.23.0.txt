= New Features

* When the email_auth feature is used, the link to request email
  authentication is now displayed if the user inputs an incorrect
  password.  Previously, it was only shown if the user had not
  yet entered a password.

* A send_email configuration method has been added, which can be
  overridden to customize email delivery (such as logging such
  email). The configuration method block accepts a Mail::Message
  argument.

* All rodauth.*_route methods that return the name of the route
  segment now have rodauth.*_path and rodauth.*_url equivalents,
  which return the path and URL for the related routes, respectively.
  The rodauth.*_path methods are useful when constructing links to
  the related Rodauth pages on the same site, and the rodauth.*_url
  methods are useful for constructing link to the Rodauth pages from
  other sites or in email.

= Other Improvements

* Specs have been removed from the gem file, reducing gem size by
  over 20%.

* rodauth.authenticated? now returns true on the OTP setup page
  when using the otp feature.  Previously, this method returned
  false on the OTP setup page.  However, as the user has not yet
  setup OTP when viewing this page, they should be considered
  fully authenticated, as they would be if they viewed any other
  page before setting up OTP.  This change probably only affects
  cases where the layout uses rodauth.authenticated?.
